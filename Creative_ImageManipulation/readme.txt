My creative submission generates 5 different types of images:
*A greyscale image stored in blackandwhite.exr
*A Sepia image stored in sepia.exr
*A wildblue image with rgb channels greyed out initially, stored in wildblue.exr
*A TVChannel image that creates the illusion of noise on an old TV. Depending on your OS, you might hive to zoom in to get this effect.
*A Pixelated image that gives the image an 'Embossed' look and feel. Stored in pixelated.exr. Depending on your OS, you might hive to zoom in to get this effect.
